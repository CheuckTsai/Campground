    "We recently enjoyed a fishing trip with you guys last Sunday and I wanted to share a few photos that we took. It was the boys first trip out on a boat and they really enjoyed themselves!! Owen got to hold a Puffer fish and he was so excited to hold this fish and play with the shrimp while on the boat! Blaine caught a trout and learned how to bait his own hook with the shrimp! We look forward to our next visit to Sanibel and our next trip with you guys!",
    "The cruise was absolutely beautiful and the entire staff was great and very friendly! We had many dolphin sightings and a beautiful sunset to wrap up our Sanibel vacation. Thank you again",
    "The day was relaxing and enjoyable. The two hour stop at the shelling beach was excellent, lunch at Barnacle Phil’s was delicious, and the boat ride–complete with dolphin sightings–was comfortable and interesting. Our guides were pleasant and accommodating. I would recommend this activity to young and old, alike.",
    "We had a WONDERFUL time! Jack and Captain Bob were great hosts. They were congenial, kind, informative, humorous, well prepared, brilliant in their jobs, and knew just exactly where to take us and what to show us. Plus they really seemed to genuinely like what they do. With you as a member of their team, you have a proven winner. We could have chosen any one of several companies we phoned, but we are so pleased with our choice of ADVENTURES IN PARADISE! Thank you so much.",

    "Absolutely perfect: captains wonderful, crowd perfect, and sunset perfect… we’ll be back.",
    "We were on the Sealife Encounter cruise on July 10th. It was a wonderful experience; both the captain and the marine biologist staff were very knowledgeable and interesting. They made the trip really enjoyable and we both learned so much. The stop on Picnic Island was also a great experience. The guide was awesome, helping us net sealife and also was so good with the children. Before we returned to the marina, we cruised to waters where there were dolphins surfing. I mentioned how wonderful this cruise was to the office staff at the resort we were staying at; they appreciated knowing how much we enjoyed the experience and would share our info with others. Thank you for this wonderful trip!",
    "…I felt compelled to let you know our thoughts. Firstly I couldn’t have been more pleased with the friendly lady who booked our cruise this evening. She was polite and extremely helpful- thank you. On our arrival for the trolley Jack was a star!! He was gracious, informative, approachable and engaging. A great asset to your business. The cruise was perfect, a beautiful evening enjoyed by all. On our return Jack’s kindness held no bounds. It certainly was a memorable experience that my children and I will cherish. A BIG thank you again.",
    "We celebrated our 1st anniversary with Adventures In Paradise, on Thursday, Aug. 23rd. What a wonderful trip, and wonderful way to celebrate our anniversary! We had such a great time!!! The crew was fabulous. We met some really nice people from all over the country, and I just can’t say enough about what a great memory this was for us, that we will cherish for the rest of our days. It was the perfect way to celebrate our anniversary, and I want to thank you guys for that. And the unexpected dolphin experience on the way back, was so special. Thank you guys again, and I will tell everyone in my life, what a great experience it was, and that if they ever get to Sanibel/Captiva, to look you up, and take that shelling trip!!! Thank you!!!",
    "VERY much enjoyed this trip! Capt. JP was very informative and Emily was a wonderful hostess. Our weather wasn't fabulous and the dolphins were shy until the last moments of daylight, but we enjoyed ourselves immensely! Thank you for a nice anniversary ride",

    "A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.",

    "Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world",
    "Life is short and the world is wide.",
    "Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.",
    "Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s OK. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.",
    "wenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover",
    "The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.",
    "My husband and I have just returned from a three-week stay in Costa Rica, and couldn't have been happier with our trip! Costa Rica is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful places on earth; and their people are some of the nicest, and most welcoming we have ever met.",
    "We had such an amazing experience that exceeded our expectations! Dan and Mandi were very responsive and a pleasure to work with from the beginning to the end. We put so much time and money into this trip and it was all worth it. Even with the additional complexities of covid-19.",
    "Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore."
